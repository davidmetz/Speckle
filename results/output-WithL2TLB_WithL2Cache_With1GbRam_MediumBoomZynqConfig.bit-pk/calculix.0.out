Decascading the MPC's

Renumbering the nodes to decrease the profile:
 old profile =            0 *2147483647+       25326
 new profile =            0 *2147483647+        7317

Determining the structure of the matrix:
number of equations
720
number of nonzero matrix elements
38178
total length of the skyline
0*2147483647+58986
percentage of nonzero skyline elements
